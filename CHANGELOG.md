# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Haskell Server-side SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [2.0.2] - 2020-10-13
### Fixed:
- Removed unused legacy &#34;sel&#34; field from flag model.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-08-28
### Fixed:
- Expanded dependency supported version range. Thanks @dbaynard!


## [2.0.0] - 2020-04-21
### Changed:
- The function `userSetKey` is now takes `Text` instead of `Maybe Text` for the key. This originally existed for compatibility with an internal test suite.

### Removed:
- The constructor `EvalErrorUserNotSpecified` has been removed from `EvalErrorKind`.

## [1.0.4] - 2020-04-06
### Fixed:
- Widened time and lens dependency ranges. Thanks @nbouscal!

## [1.0.3] - 2020-03-31
### Fixed:
- Standardize streaming retry behavior. Changed handling of status codes. Exponential back-off is now reset after 60 seconds of successful streaming.

## [1.0.2] - 2020-03-16
### Fixed:
- Added a timeout on SSE reads to 5 minutes.
- Fixed an issue where reading SSE streams would burn CPU in certain edge cases

## [1.0.1] - 2020-03-02
### Fixed:
- Client initialization status is now correctly determined by checking the feature store instead of an always in memory value. This is particularly important for usage of daemon mode. In the current implementation daemon mode evaluation always returns the default fallback value because the client never becomes initialized.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-02-24
### Fixed:
- Several haddock typos.
- Added `configSetStoreTTL`, and `configSetUseLdd` to `LaunchDarkly.Server` export list.
- Added `package.yaml` version constraints.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-02-21
### Fixed:
- Added an event delivery retry mechanism. The SDK will now try to deliver events again after one second before dropping them.
- Added a payload identity header for event delivery to prevent duplication in certain edge cases.
- Made many fields strict for more deterministic memory usage.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-02-10
### Added:
- Added support for utilizing external features stores. See `LaunchDarkly.Server.Store` for details on implementing a store. You can configure usage of a specific store with `configSetStoreBackend`.
- Added support for Redis as an external feature store. See the `launchdarkly-server-sdk-redis` package for details.
- Added support for LaunchDarkly daemon mode configurable with `configSetUseLdd`.
### Fixed:
- Incorrect ToJSON instances for flag rules and operators.
- Updated bucketing logic to fallback to last variation instead of producing an error.
- Refactored streaming implementation.
- Stopped sending empty event payloads.


## [0.1.1] - 2019-12-10
### Fixed
- Corrected internal HTTP client user agent format.

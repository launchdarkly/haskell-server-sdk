## Verifying SDK build provenance with the SLSA framework

LaunchDarkly uses the [SLSA framework](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/about) (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) to help developers make their supply chain more secure by ensuring the authenticity and build integrity of our published SDK packages.

As part of [SLSA requirements for level 3 compliance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements), LaunchDarkly publishes provenance about our SDK package builds using [GitHub's generic SLSA3 provenance generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/generic/README.md#generation-of-slsa3-provenance-for-arbitrary-projects) for distribution alongside our packages. These attestations are available for download from the GitHub release page for the release version under Assets > `multiple.intoto.jsonl`.

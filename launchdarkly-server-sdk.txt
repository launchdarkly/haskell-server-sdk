@version 4.2.0


-- | The LaunchDarkly SDK supports a subset of Aeson 1.x and 2.x. These two
--   versions differ in their type signatures, but are otherwise largely
--   compatible. To support both versions, we provide this compatibility
--   module.
--   
--   Depending on the version of Aeson you have installed, this module will
--   expose a KeyMap type that is either
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>In the case of 1.x, a HashMap T.Text, or</li>
--   <li>In the case of 2.x, the new KeyMap type</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The compatibility layer exposes common map operations that the SDK
--   needs and may prove useful to customers. In nearly all instances,
--   these are simple aliases for the underlying Aeson equivalents.
--   
--   The Aeson 2.x KeyMap is keyed by a new Key type that does not exist in
--   1.x. To keep the API as consistent as possible, all functions
--   requiring a key will provide a Text value. In the 2.x compatibility
--   layer, we will convert it to a from the appropriate Key type as
--   necessary.

-- | Reference is an attribute name or path expression identifying a value
--   within a Context.
--   
--   This type is mainly intended to be used internally by LaunchDarkly SDK
--   and service code, where efficiency is a major concern so it's
--   desirable to do any parsing or preprocessing just once. Applications
--   are unlikely to need to use the Reference type directly.
--   
--   It can be used to retrieve a value with <a>getValueForReference</a> or
--   to identify an attribute or nested value that should be considered
--   private.
--   
--   Parsing and validation are done at the time that the Reference is
--   constructed. If a Reference instance was created from an invalid
--   string, it is considered invalid. The error can be inspected with
--   <a>getError</a>.
--   
--   <h2>Syntax</h2>
--   
--   The string representation of an attribute reference in LaunchDarkly
--   JSON data uses the following syntax:
--   
--   If the first character is not a slash, the string is interpreted
--   literally as an attribute name. An attribute name can contain any
--   characters, but must not be empty.
--   
--   If the first character is a slash, the string is interpreted as a
--   slash-delimited path where the first path component is an attribute
--   name, and each subsequent path component is the name of a property in
--   a JSON object. Any instances of the characters "/" or "~" in a path
--   component are escaped as "~1" or "~0" respectively. This syntax
--   deliberately resembles JSON Pointer, but no JSON Pointer behaviors
--   other than those mentioned here are supported.
--   
--   <h2>Examples</h2>
--   
--   Suppose there is a context whose JSON implementation looks like this:
--   
--   { "kind": "user", "key": "value1", "address": { "street": { "line1":
--   "value2", "line2": "value3" }, "city": "value4" }, "good/bad":
--   "value5" }
--   
--   The attribute references "key" and "/key" would both point to
--   "value1".
--   
--   The attribute reference "<i>address</i>street/line1" would point to
--   "value2".
--   
--   The attribute references "good<i>bad" and "</i>good~1bad" would both
--   point to "value5".
module LaunchDarkly.Server.Reference

-- | data record for the Reference type.
data Reference

-- | Creates a Reference from a string. For the supported syntax and
--   examples, see comments on the <a>LaunchDarkly.Server.Reference</a>
--   module.
--   
--   This function always returns a Reference that preserves the original
--   string, even if validation fails, so that accessing <a>getRawPath</a>
--   (or serializing the Reference to JSON) will produce the original
--   string. If validation fails, <a>getError</a> will return an error and
--   any SDK method that takes this Reference as a parameter will consider
--   it invalid.
makeReference :: Text -> Reference

-- | makeLiteral is similar to <a>makeReference</a> except that it always
--   interprets the string as a literal attribute name, never as a
--   slash-delimited path expression. There is no escaping or unescaping,
--   even if the name contains literal <a>/</a> or '~' characters. Since an
--   attribute name can contain any characters, this method always returns
--   a valid Reference unless the name is empty.
--   
--   For example: <tt>makeLiteral "name"</tt> is exactly equivalent to
--   <tt>makeReference "name"</tt>. <tt>makeLiteral "a/b"</tt> is exactly
--   equivalent to <tt>makeReference "a/b"</tt> (since the syntax used by
--   <a>makeReference</a> treats the whole string as a literal as long as
--   it does not start with a slash), or to <tt>makeReference "/a~1b"</tt>.
makeLiteral :: Text -> Reference

-- | Returns True for a valid Reference; False otherwise.
--   
--   A Reference is invalid if the input string is empty, or starts with a
--   slash but is not a valid slash-delimited path, or starts with a slash
--   and contains an invalid escape sequence.
--   
--   Otherwise, the Reference is valid, but that does not guarantee that
--   such an attribute exists in any given Context. For instance,
--   <tt>makeReference "name"</tt> is a valid Reference, but a specific
--   Context might or might not have a name.
--   
--   See comments on the <a>LaunchDarkly.Server.Reference</a> module for
--   more details of the attribute reference syntax.
isValid :: Reference -> Bool

-- | Returns an empty string for a valid Reference, or a Text error
--   description for an invalid Reference.
--   
--   See comments on the <a>LaunchDarkly.Server.Reference</a> module for
--   more details of the attribute reference syntax.
getError :: Reference -> Text

-- | Retrieves path components from the attribute reference.
--   
--   Invalid references will return an empty list.
--   
--   <pre>
--   makeReference "" &amp; getComponents     -- returns []
--   makeReference "a" &amp; getComponents    -- returns ["a"]
--   makeReference "/a/b" &amp; getComponents -- returns ["a", "b"]
--   </pre>
getComponents :: Reference -> [Text]

-- | Returns the attribute reference as a string, in the same format
--   provided to <a>makeReference</a>.
--   
--   If the Reference was created with <a>makeReference</a>, this value is
--   identical to the original string. If it was created with
--   <a>makeLiteral</a>, the value may be different due to unescaping (for
--   instance, an attribute whose name is "/a" would be represented as
--   "~1a").

-- | A mechanism for providing dynamically updatable feature flag state in
--   a simplified form to an SDK client in test scenarios.
--   
--   Unlike <a>LaunchDarkly.Server.Integrations.FileData</a>, this
--   mechanism does not use any external resources. It provides only the
--   data that the application has put into it using the <a>update</a>
--   function.
--   
--   <pre>
--   td &lt;- TestData.newTestData
--   update td =&lt;&lt; (flag td "flag-key-1"
--                   &lt;&amp;&gt; booleanFlag
--                   &lt;&amp;&gt; variationForAll True)
--   
--   let config = makeConfig "sdkKey"
--                   &amp; configSetDataSourceFactory (dataSourceFactory td)
--   client &lt;- makeClient config
--   
--   -- flags can be updated at any time:
--   update td =&lt;&lt;
--      (flag td "flag-key-2"
--            &lt;&amp;&gt; variationForKey "user" "some-user-key" True
--            &lt;&amp;&gt; fallthroughVariation False)
--   </pre>
--   
--   The above example uses a simple boolean flag, but more complex
--   configurations are possible using the methods of the
--   <a>FlagBuilder</a> that is returned by <a>flag</a>. <a>FlagBuilder</a>
--   supports many of the ways a flag can be configured on the LaunchDarkly

--   see <a>LaunchDarkly.Server.Integrations.FileData</a>
module LaunchDarkly.Server.Integrations.TestData
data TestData

-- | Creates a new instance of the test data source.
newTestData :: IO TestData

-- | Creates or copies a <a>FlagBuilder</a> for building a test flag
--   configuration.
--   
--   If this flag key has already been defined in this <a>TestData</a>
--   instance, then the builder starts with the same configuration that was
--   last provided for this flag.
--   
--   Otherwise, it starts with a new default configuration in which the
--   flag has <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt> variations, is <tt>True</tt>
--   for all users when targeting is turned on and <tt>False</tt>
--   otherwise, and currently has targeting turned on. You can change any
--   of those properties, and provide more complex behavior, using the
--   <a>FlagBuilder</a> methods.

flag :: TestData -> Text -> IO FlagBuilder

-- | Updates the test data with the specified flag configuration.
--   
--   This has the same effect as if a flag were added or modified on the
--   LaunchDarkly dashboard. It immediately propagates the flag change to
--   any <a>Client</a> instance(s) that you have already configured to use
--   this <a>TestData</a>. If no <tt>Client</tt> has been started yet, it
--   simply adds this flag to the test data which will be provided to any
--   <tt>Client</tt> that you subsequently configure.

data FlagBuilder

-- | A shortcut for setting the flag to use the standard boolean
--   configuration.
--   
--   This is the default for all new flags created with <a>flag</a>. The
--   flag will have two variations, <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt> (in
--   that order); it will return <tt>False</tt> whenever targeting is off,
--   and <tt>True</tt> when targeting is on if no other settings specify
--   otherwise.
booleanFlag :: FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Sets targeting to be on or off for this flag.
--   
--   The effect of this depends on the rest of the flag configuration, just
--   as it does on the real LaunchDarkly dashboard. In the default
--   configuration that you get from calling <a>flag</a> with a new flag
--   key, the flag will return <tt>False</tt> whenever targeting is off,
--   and <tt>True</tt> when targeting is on.
on :: Bool -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Specifies the fallthrough variation. The fallthrough is the value that

--   
--   If the flag was previously configured with other variations and the
--   variation specified is a boolean, this also changes it to a boolean
--   flag.
fallthroughVariation :: Variation val => val -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Specifies the off variation for a flag. This is the variation that is

--   
--   If the flag was previously configured with other variations and the
--   variation specified is a boolean, this also changes it to a boolean
--   flag.
offVariation :: Variation val => val -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Sets the flag to always return the specified variation for all
--   contexts.
--   
--   The variation is specified, Targeting is switched on, and any existing
--   targets or rules are removed. The fallthrough variation is set to the
--   specified value. The off variation is left unchanged.
--   
--   If the flag was previously configured with other variations and the
--   variation specified is a boolean, this also changes it to a boolean
--   flag.
variationForAll :: Variation val => val -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Sets the flag to always return the specified variation for all users.
--   
--   The variation is specified, Targeting is switched on, and any existing
--   targets or rules are removed. The fallthrough variation is set to the
--   specified value. The off variation is left unchanged.

variationForAllUsers :: Variation val => val -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Sets the flag to always return the specified variation value for all

--   
--   The value may be of any type that implements <a>ToJSON</a>. This
--   method changes the flag to have only a single variation, which is this

--   This has no effect when targeting is turned off for the flag.
--   
--   If the flag was previously configured with other variations and the

variationForKey :: Variation val => Text -> Text -> val -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Sets the flag to return the specified variation for a specific user

-- | <i>Deprecated: Use variationForKey instead</i>
variationForUser :: Variation val => Text -> val -> FlagBuilder -> FlagBuilder

-- | Changes the allowable variation values for the flag.
--   
--   The value may be of any JSON type, as defined by <a>Value</a>. For

-- | A builder for feature flag rules to be used with <a>FlagBuilder</a>.
--   
--   In the LaunchDarkly model, a flag can have any number of rules, and a

--   such as "name is 'X'". A rule matches a context if all of the rule's
--   clauses match the context.
--   
--   To start defining a rule, use one of the matching functions such as
--   <a>ifMatch</a> or <a>ifNotMatch</a>. This defines the first clause for
--   the rule.
--   
--   Optionally, you may add more clauses with the rule builder functions

--   <a>dataSourceFactory</a> for details.
module LaunchDarkly.Server.Integrations.FileData

-- | Creates a <tt>DataSourceFactory</tt> which uses the configured file
--   data sources.
--   
--   This allows you to use local files as a source of feature flag state,
--   instead of using an actual LaunchDarkly connection.
--   
--   To use the file dataSource you can add it to the <a>Config</a> using
--   <a>configSetDataSourceFactory</a>
--   
--   <pre>
--   let config = configSetDataSourceFactory (FileData.dataSourceFactory [".<i>testData</i>flags.json"]) $
--                makeConfig "sdk-key"
--   client &lt;- makeClient config
--   </pre>
--   
--   This will cause the client <i>not</i> to connect to LaunchDarkly to
--   get feature flags. The client may still make network connections to
--   send analytics events, unless you have disabled this with
--   <a>configSetSendEvents</a> to <tt>False</tt>. IMPORTANT: Do <i>not</i>
--   set <a>configSetOffline</a> to <tt>True</tt>; doing so would not just
--   put the SDK "offline" with regard to LaunchDarkly, but will completely
--   turn off all flag data sources to the SDK /including the file data
--   source/.
--   
--   Flag data files can be either JSON or YAML. They contain an object
--   with three possible properties:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i><tt>flags</tt></i> Feature flag definitions.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>flagValues</tt></i> Simplified feature flags that contain
--   only a value.</li>
--   <li><i><tt>segments</tt></i> Context segment definitions.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The format of the data in <tt>flags</tt> and <tt>segments</tt> is
--   defined by the LaunchDarkly application and is subject to change.
--   Rather than trying to construct these objects yourself, it is simpler
--   to request existing flags directly from the LaunchDarkly server in
--   JSON format, and use this output as the starting point for your file.
--   In Linux you would do this:
--   
--   <pre>
--   curl -H "Authorization: {your sdk key}" <a>https://sdk.launchdarkly.com/sdk/latest-all</a>
--   </pre>
--   
--   The output will look something like this (but with many more
--   properties):
--   
--   <pre>
--   {
--       "flags": {
--           "flag-key-1": {
--               "key": "flag-key-1",
--               "on": true,
--               "variations": [ "a", "b" ]
--           },
--           "flag-key-2": {
--               "key": "flag-key-2",
--               "on": true,
--               "variations": [ "c", "d" ]
--           }
--       },
--       "segments": {
--           "segment-key-1": {
--               "key": "segment-key-1",
--               "includes": [ "user-key-1" ]
--           }
--       }
--   }
--   </pre>
--   
--   Data in this format allows the SDK to exactly duplicate all the kinds
--   of flag behavior supported by LaunchDarkly. However, in many cases you
--   will not need this complexity, but will just want to set specific flag
--   keys to specific values. For that, you can use a much simpler format:
--   
--   <pre>
--   {
--       "flagValues": {
--           "my-string-flag-key": "value-1",
--           "my-boolean-flag-key": true,
--           "my-integer-flag-key": 3
--       }
--   }
--   </pre>
--   
--   Or, in YAML:
--   
--   <pre>
--   flagValues:
--     my-string-flag-key: "value-1"
--     my-boolean-flag-key: true
--   </pre>
--   
--   It is also possible to specify both <tt>flags</tt> and
--   <tt>flagValues</tt>, if you want some flags to have simple values and
--   others to have complex behavior. However, it is an error to use the
--   same flag key or segment key more than once, either in a single file
--   or across multiple files.
--   
--   If the data source encounters any error in any file(malformed content,
--   a missing file) it will not load flags from that file. If the data
--   source encounters a duplicate key it will ignore that duplicate entry.

-- | Context is a collection of attributes that can be referenced in flag
--   evaluations and analytics events.
--   
--   To create a Context of a single kind, such as a user, you may use
--   <a>makeContext</a>.
--   
--   To create an LDContext with multiple kinds, use
--   <a>makeMultiContext</a>.
--   
--   Additional properties can be set on a single-kind context using the
--   set methods found in this module.
--   
--   Each method will always return a Context. However, that Context may be
--   invalid. You can check the validity of the resulting context, and the
--   associated errors by calling <a>isValid</a> and <a>getError</a>.
module LaunchDarkly.Server.Context

-- | data record for the Context type
data Context

-- | Create a single kind context from the provided hash.
--   
--   The provided hash must match the format as outlined in the <a>SDK
--   documentation</a>.
makeContext :: Text -> Text -> Context

-- | Create a multi-kind context from the list of Contexts provided.
--   
--   A multi-kind context is comprised of two or more single kind contexts.
--   You cannot include a multi-kind context instead another multi-kind
--   context.
--   
--   Additionally, the kind of each single-kind context must be unique. For
--   instance, you cannot create a multi-kind context that includes two
--   user kind contexts.
--   
--   If you attempt to create a multi-kind context from one single-kind
--   context, this method will return the single-kind context instead of a
--   new multi-kind context wrapping that one single-kind.
makeMultiContext :: [Context] -> Context

-- | Sets the name attribute for a single-kind context.
--   
--   Calling this method on an invalid or multi-kind context is a no-op.
withName :: Text -> Context -> Context

-- | Sets the anonymous attribute for a single-kind context.
--   
--   Calling this method on an invalid or multi-kind context is a no-op.
withAnonymous :: Bool -> Context -> Context

-- | Sets the value of any attribute for the context.
--   
--   This includes only attributes that are addressable in evaluations --
--   not metadata such as private attributes. For example, if the attribute
--   name is "privateAttributes", you will be setting an attribute with
--   that name which you can use in evaluations or to record data for your
--   own purposes, but it will be unrelated to
--   <a>withPrivateAttributes</a>.
--   
--   If attribute name is "privateAttributeNames", it is ignored and no
--   attribute is set.
--   
--   This method uses the Value type to represent a value of any JSON type:
--   null, boolean, number, string, array, or object. For all attribute
--   names that do not have special meaning to LaunchDarkly, you may use
--   any of those types. Values of different JSON types are always treated
--   as different values: for instance, null, false, and the empty string
--   "" are not the same, and the number 1 is not the same as the string
--   "1".
--   
--   The following attribute names have special restrictions on their value
--   types, and any value of an unsupported type will be ignored (leaving
--   the attribute unchanged):
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>"name": Must be a string.</li>
--   <li>"anonymous": Must be a boolean.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The attribute name "_meta" is not allowed, because it has special
--   meaning in the JSON schema for contexts; any attempt to set an
--   attribute with this name has no effect.
--   
--   The attribute names "kind" and "key" are not allowed. They must be
--   provided during the initial context creation. See <a>makeContext</a>.
--   
--   Values that are JSON arrays or objects have special behavior when
--   referenced in flag/segment rules.
--   
--   For attributes that aren't subject to the special restrictions
--   mentioned above, a value of Null is equivalent to removing any current
--   non-default value of the attribute. Null is not a valid attribute
--   value in the LaunchDarkly model; any expressions in feature flags that
--   reference an attribute with a null value will behave as if the
--   attribute did not exist.
--   
--   Calling this method on an invalid or multi-kind context is a no-op.
withAttribute :: Text -> Value -> Context -> Context

-- | Sets the private attributes for a single-kind context.
--   
--   Calling this method on an invalid or multi-kind context is a no-op.
withPrivateAttributes :: Set Reference -> Context -> Context

-- | Determines if the provided context is valid.
isValid :: Context -> Bool

-- | Returns the error associated with the context if it is invalid.
getError :: Context -> Text

-- | Returns the single-kind Context corresponding to one of the kinds in
--   this context.
--   
--   If this method is called on a single-kind Context and the requested
--   kind matches the context's kind, then that context is returned.
--   
--   If the method is called on a multi-context, the provided kind must
--   match the context kind of one of the individual contexts.
--   
--   If there is no context corresponding to
--   <a>$sel:kind:SingleContext</a>, the method returns Nothing.
getIndividualContext :: Text -> Context -> Maybe Context

-- | Looks up the value of any attribute of the Context, or a value
--   contained within an attribute, based on a <a>Reference</a> instance.
--   This includes only attributes that are addressable in evaluations--
--   not metadata such as private attributes.
--   
--   This implements the same behavior that the SDK uses to resolve
--   attribute references during a flag evaluation. In a single-kind
--   context, the <a>Reference</a> can represent a simple attribute name--
--   either a built-in one like "name" or "key", or a custom attribute --
--   or, it can be a slash-delimited path using a JSON-Pointer-like syntax.
--   See <a>Reference</a> for more details.
--   
--   For a multi-kind context, the only supported attribute name is "kind".
--   Use <a>getIndividualContext</a> to inspect a Context for a particular
--   kind and then get its attributes.
--   
--   If the value is found, the return value is the attribute value;
--   otherwise, it is Null.
getValueForReference :: Reference -> Context -> Value

-- | Looks up the value of any attribute of the Context by name. This
--   includes only attributes that are addressable in evaluations-- not
--   metadata such as private attributes.
--   
--   For a single-kind context, the attribute name can be any custom
--   attribute. It can also be one of the built-in ones like "kind", "key",
--   or "name".
--   
--   For a multi-kind context, the only supported attribute name is "kind".
--   Use <a>getIndividualContext</a> to inspect a Context for a particular
--   kind and then get its attributes.
--   
--   This method does not support complex expressions for getting
--   individual values out of JSON objects or arrays, such as
--   "<i>address</i>street". Use <a>getValueForReference</a> for that
--   purpose.
--   
--   If the value is found, the return value is the attribute value;
--   otherwise, it is Null.

configSetStreaming :: Bool -> Config -> Config

-- | The initial delay in milliseconds before reconnecting after an error
--   in the SSE client. Defaults to 1 second.
--   
--   This only applies to the streaming connection. Providing a

configSetInitialRetryDelay :: Int -> Config -> Config

-- | Sets whether or not all context attributes (other than the key) should

configSetAllAttributesPrivate :: Bool -> Config -> Config

-- | Marks a set of context attribute names private. Any contexts sent to
--   LaunchDarkly with this configuration active will have attributes with
--   these names removed.
configSetPrivateAttributeNames :: Set Reference -> Config -> Config

-- | The time between flushes of the event buffer. Decreasing the flush
--   interval means that the event buffer is less likely to reach capacity.
configSetFlushIntervalSeconds :: Natural -> Config -> Config

-- | The polling interval (when streaming is disabled).
configSetPollIntervalSeconds :: Natural -> Config -> Config

--   events from the server.
configSetSendEvents :: Bool -> Config -> Config

-- | Sets whether this client is offline. An offline client will not make

--   until all pending analytics events have been sent.
close :: Client -> IO ()

-- | Flush tells the client that all pending analytics events (if any)
--   should be delivered as soon as possible. Flushing is asynchronous, so
--   this method will return before it is complete.
flushEvents :: Client -> IO ()

-- | Identify reports details about a context.
identify :: Client -> Context -> IO ()

-- | Track reports that a context has performed an event. Custom data can
--   be attached to the event, and / or a numeric value.
